It’s no secret that going to the opera is a luxury. But at Dubai Opera no one will be alienated with sky high ticket prices. The 200 plus shows a year schedule means ticket prices will be taken on a show by show basis dictated by the length of the artists' run and how much they charge to perform at the venue. </p>

The ground floor of the museum is made up of 6 different rooms including the different roasting and brewing styles from various countries, which are live demonstrated. The first floor of the museum offers a large selection of books about the history of coffee as well as documentaries that visitors can watch in the media room.

The menu features small platters of European haute cuisine and delicious street food.  At.mosphere is one place that’s definitely worth a visit.

If you prefer to stay inside, then sit by their ceiling to floor windows which offer Dubai's full display of skyline lights, including views of the Burj Khalifa and DIFC. Enjoy creative beverages and a high end dinner service with a selection of Japanese specialty sharing plates, with favourites including Maldivian Tuna Poke, Vermicelli Noodles and Yellow Chilli Chicken Gyoza. </p>
